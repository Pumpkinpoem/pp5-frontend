## Color Scheme

### Color Palette

For this project, I have selected a cozy and inviting color palette to align with the brand identity, which is focused on book clubs and creating a comfortable, easy-on-the-eyes experience.

#### Primary Colors:

- **Light Moss Green (#CBDFBD):** A soft, soothing green that serves as the main background color, providing a calming atmosphere.
- **Soft Buttercream (#F6F4D2):** A gentle off white used for borders, adding a warm contrast without being too harsh.
- **Chestnut (#A44A3F):** A rich, warm color used for primary text, ensuring excellent readability against the lighter backgrounds.
- **Light Sage (#D4E09B):** A light, creamy color used for secondary text, keeping the design soft and easy to read.
- **Peachy Coral (#F19C79):** A vibrant orange used sparingly for accent elements like buttons and links, drawing attention without overwhelming the user.

### What Does Analogous Mean in Color Theory?

In color theory, an **analogous** color scheme involves colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. These colors usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs. The analogous scheme used here incorporates shades of green, yellow, and orange to achieve a harmonious and welcoming look that resonates with the warmth and community spirit of book clubs.
